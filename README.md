# 📺 OTT Content Analysis – Netflix, Amazon Prime & Disney+

# 📊 Data Cleaning | 📈 Visualization | 📡 Tableau Dashboard

This project analyzes content from Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+, focusing on merging datasets, cleaning inconsistencies, and creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to uncover insights about OTT platforms.

# 🚀 Project Overview

With the explosion of streaming services, understanding content distribution, trends, and audience targeting is crucial. This project:

✅ Merges three different datasets to create a unified OTT catalog.

✅ Cleans and preprocesses 10,000+ titles, handling missing values and standardizing ratings.

✅ Builds interactive visualizations in Tableau to explore platform-wise trends.

# 🛠️ Data Processing

1️⃣ Merging Datasets

Collected datasets for Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+.

Combined them into a single dataframe while handling duplicates and missing data.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Standardized content ratings (e.g., TV-MA, PG-13, R) into three categories: Kids, Teens, Adults.

Removed inconsistent entries (e.g., incorrect durations like "66 minutes").

Handled missing values for directors, cast, country, and release dates.

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed the most common genres, content production trends, and platform distributions.

Identified top-producing countries and release year trends.

# 📊 Tableau Dashboard

Key Visualizations:

✅ Content Distribution: Movies vs. TV Shows on each platform.

✅ Genre Popularity: Most common genres across streaming services.

✅ Top Countries: Which countries produce the most content?

✅ Release Year Trends: How content production has evolved over time.

✅ Platform Comparison: Number of titles per OTT service.
